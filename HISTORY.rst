History
-------

1.1.0 (2014-11-20)
------------------
Blog entries can now have tags
 * The entry model now supports tags by way of the django-taggit package.
 * This affects the model only, there are no template examples or tags.

1.0.0 (2014-11-20)
------------------
**Backwards Incompatible with 0.1.0.**
This release includes a rename of the django app package from djangoandablog to andablog to better follow
community conventions. This of course is a very large breaking change, which is why the version is 1.0.
As this is the second version and we have been out such a short time. My hope is that few if any people
are using this app yet. If you are, please submit an issue on GitHub and I will try to help you migrate away.

0.1.0 (2014-11-16)
------------------

* First release on PyPI.
